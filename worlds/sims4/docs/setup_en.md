## Setting up
- This mod only uses skills from the base game as checks and locations. Make sure to disable your packs as they are likely to break the mod. 
  * If you dont know how to do so you can use this [tutorial](https://jamesturner.yt/disablepacks) by James Turner
- Open the archipelago launcher and run The Sims 4 client and connect to the server.
- Start The Sims 4 and make a new save
  * You can use an existing save but its better to use a new save as this mod will reset your sims' skills on connect
